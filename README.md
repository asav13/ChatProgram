```
	npm install
```

```
	node chatServer.js
```

### Run the client
You need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> to run the client. Inside the /client folder run the following command for  <b>Python 2</b>:
```
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
or the following command for <b>Python 3</b>:
```
	python -m http.server 8000
```

### Start the application
Then open http://localhost:8000 while both server and client are running.
```
	explorer http://localhost:8000
